### Design 

- ### Color Scheme

I wanted to choose a fairly minimal color scheme for this project as there would be pictures uploaded to the site via URL from the user.  Not knowing what these pictures would be I kept the colours minimal as to try and avoid clashing.
The colours used were based off of the colour sage #9DC183 to tie in with the food theme. 

- ### Fonts

All text is rendered in Roboto as it is easy to read and widely used. Giving the site a sense of familiarity to new users. This was obtained from Google Fonts. 

- ### Layout 

The site is designed to work and be used on various screen sizes with the layout changing responsively thanks to Materializecss.
